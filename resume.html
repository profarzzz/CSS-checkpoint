    <h3>Nizar Ben Hassine</h3>

 
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    We have been working with web development since 2010, the period during which I have worked in different environments, from big consultancy companies to start-ups. I am a self-motivated and self-taught professional who likes to solve problems.

    We merge a passion for usability and user experience with technical knowledge to create cool digital experiences. My repertoire includes programming languages and tools such as ReactJS, EmberJS, Mobx, Wordpress, SailsJS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Nginx and Apache server configuration, Gulp, SASS, LESS, Twitter Bootstrap, Susy, jQuery, and more.
    
<h2>Work experiences</h2>
    
    As the first developer to integrate the team in this greenfield project, my goal is to create interfaces for our new product utilizing ReactJS + Sass, using Mobx as our state management system. The main focus is to create reusable components that could be used in future projects by the team
    
    Keep the code quality high reviewing code from other developers and suggesting improvements
    Interact with the designer to suggest changes and to make sure the view he has about the design is translated into actual functionality
